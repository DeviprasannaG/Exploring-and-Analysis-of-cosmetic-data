# Exploring-and-Analysis-of-cosmetoc-data

By scraping the websites of Amazon, Flipkart, Ulta, and Sephora, a cosmetics dataset was curated with the features needed to perform the required analysis tasks. The products were clustered based on similarities in their ingredients, and the most recurring ingredients were visualized. The impact of different features on product prices was studied, and the price range and actual price for future products were predicted using various algorithms. The highest performance for these were 0.73 (accuracy) and 0.02 (mse) respectively. Furthermore, the research examined the popularity of different brands, visualized the effect of the website on customer engagement, and analyzed the distribution of products across each category and subcategory. Additionally, the study visualized the effect of skin types on ingredients. These findings provide valuable insights into the online cosmetics market, which can aid businesses in making informed decisions and improving customer satisfaction.
